*Thank you for purchasing my Coconut Palm Tree Package. I hope this pack helps you with your project. 

*There is the 	-Coconut Palm Material folder for the materials.
				-Coconut Palm Prefab folder for the actual trees.
				-Coconut Palm Texture folder for the textures.


*Some of the textures are from cgtextures.com. Images were edited in GIMP, xNormal, and Blender.

*Tree were created in the Unity Tree Creator.

*Trees have wind animation set up so just add a windzone. Recommend raising the Wind Pulse Magnitude to 1 and the Wind Pulse Frequency to .5. 	

*Included in the leaf materials is the diffuse, normal, gloss, and translucency texture. The bark includes the diffuse, normal, and gloss.

*I set up the capsule colliders on the trees so when you have Create Tree Colliders option selected on your terrain you will have
 collision on part of your tree.
 
*Update 1.1
 	*Changed bark texture. If you prefer the original bark texture it is included.
 	*Improved the leaf textures.
 	*Added 2 more trees.
